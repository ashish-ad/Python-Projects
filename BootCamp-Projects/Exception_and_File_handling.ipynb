Look at the following example, which asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using Control-C or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled by raising the [KeyboardInterrupt](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt) exception."
