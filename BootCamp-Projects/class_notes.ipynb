    "Object-Oriented Programming. Pretty standard, good vibes. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Object-Oriented though? It's good to model programming structures like how real world objects are like! Real world objects have properties (colour, height, etc.) and abilities (run, walk, swim)! \n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 objects have Attributes/Properties and Methods! These are collectively known as the Members of an object!\n",
    "\n",
    "> The basis for all object oriented programming languages is the manipulation of **objects**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Objects** contain **Attributes** and **Methods**. These two can be referred to collectively as the **Members** of the **Object's Class**.\n",

    ">  These subsections are pulled from my PHP OOP reference, but I'm including them here for convenience's sake \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects** act a lot like real-world objects. They:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be **created** or **destroyed**\n",
    "- Are instances of **Classes**\n",
    "- Have manipulable **Properties/Attributes**\n",
    "- Have callable **Methods** (it's like calling functions!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes** define the **Attributes** and **Methods** of objects that belong to them! Attributes and Methods are referred collectively as the class' **Members**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, you can have a class that defines an object with the property: \"Colour\", but the instance of the class (the object), can have any value within that property (Red, Black, etc.) **You can also state the default value of the class otherwise!**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:** **methylDragon** is an object that belongs to the **Dragon** class. This gives him default attributes like:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Color: Red\n",
    "> Sound: [\"Rawr\"]  (This is an array because the object might make multiple sounds)\n",
    "> Breath: Fire\n",

    "> And methods like:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Sound()\n",
    "> Talk()\n",
    "> Walk()\n",
    "> Eat()\n",
    "> Fly()\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Note:** When constructing an object belonging to a class, you **can** override the default values defined by the class. So when defining **methylDragon**, you can give him alternative attribute values! Like the **Color: Black**!\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Example:** The class **Dragon** has a child class (sub-class) **Music_Dragon** that **methylDragon** belongs to! \n",
    ">\n",
    "> This can confer new methods or attributes (Like... A stage-name, and music making ability) **in addition** to any attributes and methods the **Dragon** class conferred.\n",
    ">\n",
